# movie_recommendation_engine
This project demonstrates a Netflix-style recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The recommendation engine is designed to predict and suggest movies or TV shows that a user is likely to enjoy based on their viewing history and the preferences of other users.

Key Features:
Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes user-item interactions (e.g., ratings, watch history) to recommend content by finding patterns and similarities among users and items.
Content-Based Filtering: Incorporates movie metadata such as genres, cast, and plot summaries to recommend similar content based on a user's past preferences.
Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate and personalized recommendations.
Matrix Factorization: Implements techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce dimensionality and handle sparse data in user-item matrices.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and Precision@K to measure the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.
Python Libraries: Built using libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy for data processing and model implementation.


How It Works:
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms the raw data to prepare it for model training.
Model Training: Applies collaborative and content-based filtering methods.
Recommendation Generation: Generates personalized recommendations based on the trained model.
Performance Evaluation: Assesses the accuracy of the recommendations using various metrics.
